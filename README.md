In modern software architecture, efficiently managing varying workloads is crucial for maintaining system performance and reliability. The **Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern** addresses this challenge by introducing a queue between producers and consumers, decoupling task submission from processing. This approach allows systems to handle intermittent heavy loads gracefully.

**Implementing Queue-Based Load Leveling in Java**

In Java applications, the Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern can be implemented using constructs like `BlockingQueue`. This approach is suitable for simple, single-instance applications but may face challenges in distributed, cloud-based environments.

**Limitations of In-Memory Queues:**

- **Scalability:** In-memory queues are confined to the application's memory space, making it challenging to scale across multiple instances or services.

- **Durability:** Messages in an in-memory queue are lost if the application crashes or restarts, leading to potential data loss.

- **Decoupling:** Tightly couples the producer and consumer within the same application context, reducing flexibility.

**Implementing Queue-Based Load Leveling with Azure Service Bus in Java**

For distributed, cloud-based applications, leveraging a managed messaging service like **Azure Service Bus** offers several advantages:

- **Scalability:** Enables seamless scaling across multiple services and instances, accommodating varying workloads.

- **Durability:** Ensures message persistence, preventing data loss in case of failures.

- **Decoupling:** Allows producers and consumers to operate independently, enhancing system modularity and maintainability.

The **Modern Web App (MWA) pattern** for Java applications provides a practical example of implementing the Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern using Azure Service Bus. In this implementation, the email delivery functionality is extracted from the monolithic application into a standalone service. This decoupled service processes email requests asynchronously using Azure Service Bus.

**Producer (Main Application):**

The main application sends email requests to an Azure Service Bus queue. This is achieved using the `StreamBridge` class in Spring Boot to asynchronously publish messages without blocking the calling thread.

```java
import org.springframework.cloud.stream.function.StreamBridge;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class SupportGuideQueueSender {

    private final StreamBridge streamBridge;

    public SupportGuideQueueSender(StreamBridge streamBridge) {
        this.streamBridge = streamBridge;
    }

    public void send(String to, String guideUrl, Long requestId) {
        EmailRequest emailRequest = EmailRequest.newBuilder()
                .setRequestId(requestId)
                .setEmailAddress(to)
                .setUrlToManual(guideUrl)
                .build();

        streamBridge.send("emailRequest-out-0", emailRequest);
    }
}
```

In this code, the `SupportGuideQueueSender` service constructs an `EmailRequest` object and sends it to the `emailRequest-out-0` binding, which is configured to route messages to the Azure Service Bus queue.

**Consumer (Email Processor Service):**

A separate service, deployed as an Azure Container App, listens to the Service Bus queue and processes incoming email requests. This service is designed to scale based on the queue length, ensuring efficient handling of varying workloads.

```java
import org.springframework.cloud.stream.annotation.StreamListener;
import org.springframework.messaging.handler.annotation.Payload;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class EmailProcessor {

    @StreamListener("emailRequest-in-0")
    public void handleEmailRequest(@Payload EmailRequest emailRequest) {
        // Process the email request
        // For example, send an email using the provided details
    }
}
```

Here, the `EmailProcessor` service listens to the `emailRequest-in-0` binding, processes the `EmailRequest` messages, and performs the necessary actions, such as sending emails.

**Autoscaling Configuration:**

The email processor service is configured to scale automatically based on the length of the Service Bus queue. This is achieved using the Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA) component in Azure Container Apps.

```hcl
resource "azurerm_container_app" "email_processor" {
  name                = "email-processor"
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
  location            = var.location

  template {
    containers {
      name   = "email-processor"
      image  = var.email_processor_image
      cpu    = "0.25"
      memory = "0.5Gi"

      env {
        name  = "SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING"
        value = var.service_bus_connection_string
      }
    }

    scale {
      min_replicas = 1
      max_replicas = 10

      rules {
        name = "servicebus-queue"
        custom {
          type = "azure-servicebus"
          metadata = {
            queueName = var.service_bus_queue_name
            messageCount = "5"
          }
          auth {
            triggerParameter = "connection"
            secretRef        = "servicebus-connection-string"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this Terraform configuration, the `email-processor` container app is set to scale between 1 and 10 replicas based on the number of messages in the Service Bus queue. For every 5 messages in the queue, an additional replica is added, allowing the system to handle increased load efficiently.
